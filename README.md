# Blinky Box

This is my slight update to [Miria Grunick's Blinky Box](https://github.com/miria/BlinkyBox).

Three changes:
1. I added a switch so the box has two modes:
  1. Solid color mode - each LED pulses with the same color as the button pushed
  2. Animated mode - each LED iterates over a preset routine
2. The rotary switch controls the speed at which LEDs pulse
3. I put all the controls on the front panel and had a new panel laser cut. Hence the .svg/.eps is included
  * I recommend that you slightly increase the width of each arcade button in the .svg. My green button is stuck down as the hole is just a little too tight
